A remake of "Motherload" for GBA

Information

This is a game based on "Motherload" and is made as a project for "Software ontwerp in C/C++".
The project is built based on the "gba-sprite-engine" from Wouter Groeneveld and is specifically designed for
the Game Boy Advance. (https://github.com/wgroeneveld/gba-sprite-engine)

The Game is based on "Motherload" but is heavilly adjusted for a good gameplay on the GBA.


Controls and gameplay
	- Arrow up: flying
	- Arrow down: drilling down
	- Arrow left: moving left/ drilling left
	- Arrow Right: moving right/ drilling right
	- A (x on pc emulator) refuel when at sea level

	The meaning of the game is to stay as long as possible alive to gain a high score which will be stored on the device played on.
	To stay alive, the player needs to earn money, this by mining the different ores in the ground. To refuel he needs to go back to ground floor to refuel.
	But flying (going up) is the most energy consuming action. The energy consumption increases when the level increases (this happens at certain chosen scores). 
	When the players levels up, the fuel cost and the level up cost also increase in exchange of a faster increase of the score (higher multiplier).
	The battery indicator on the left top corner of the screen indicates how much energy the character has left.
	If the character has run out of energy, the game is over.
	Lava will instantly kill the player when touched. Rocks cannot be drilled, drilling upwards is not possible.
